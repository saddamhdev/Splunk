## 🏦 How **Splunk** is used in **Banks** (real-world, no fluff)

Banks use **Splunk** as a **central nervous system** for **security, compliance, fraud detection, and operations visibility**. It’s not just “log search”—it’s **risk control at scale**.

---

## 🔐 1) Security Operations (SOC / SIEM)

**Primary use in banks**

**What Splunk watches**

* Firewalls, WAF, IDS/IPS
* Core banking apps
* VPNs, IAM/AD, endpoint agents
* Cloud & on-prem systems

**What banks get**

* Real-time attack detection
* Correlation across systems
* Automated alerts & triage

**Example**

> 10 failed logins → unusual country → privileged account
> ➡️ **Alert + auto ticket + block**

---

## 💳 2) Fraud Detection & Transaction Monitoring

**Very high value**

**Data sources**

* Card transactions
* ATM & POS logs
* Mobile / Internet banking events
* Geo/IP intelligence

**Patterns detected**

* Velocity anomalies (too many txns fast)
* Geo-impossible logins
* Device fingerprint mismatch
* Merchant abuse

**Outcome**

* Near real-time fraud flags
* Evidence for chargeback disputes

---

## 📜 3) Regulatory Compliance & Auditing

**Non-negotiable for banks**

Splunk helps meet:

* PCI-DSS
* SOX
* ISO 27001
* GDPR
* Local central bank audits

**How**

* Immutable audit trails
* Long-term log retention
* “Who accessed what, when, from where”

**Auditor question**

> “Show all admin actions for last 90 days.”
> **Answer in seconds** with Splunk.

---

## ⚙️ 4) Core Banking App Monitoring (Ops / SRE)

**Downtime = money + reputation**

**Monitored**

* Core banking APIs
* Payment gateways
* Loan origination systems
* Batch jobs (EOD, settlement)

**Use cases**

* SLA tracking
* Root-cause analysis
* Capacity planning

**Example**

> Payment latency spike at 2:03 PM
> ➡️ Find failing service + DB query in minutes

---

## 🧠 5) Insider Threat Detection

**Quiet but critical**

Splunk correlates:

* Employee access logs
* Unusual data exports
* Off-hours activity
* Privilege escalation

**Result**

* Early detection of internal misuse
* Evidence-based investigations

---

## 🏗️ Typical Bank Architecture (simplified)

```
Apps (Core, Cards, Mobile, ATM)
 → Forwarders / HEC
 → Splunk Indexers (cluster)
 → Search Heads
 → SOC / Compliance / Ops Dashboards
```

* **Prod**: Large clusters, strict RBAC
* **Non-prod**: Smaller, same patterns

## 👥 Who uses Splunk inside a bank?

| Team       | How they use it                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| SOC        | Threat detection, incident response |
| Fraud      | Transaction anomaly analysis        |
| Compliance | Audits & reporting                  |
| SRE / Ops  | Availability & performance          |
| App Teams  | Debugging production issues         |

---

## 🧩 Why banks prefer Splunk (honest reasons)

* Mature SIEM content
* Proven at massive scale
* Strong RBAC & auditability
* Vendor support & compliance trust

Yes, it’s expensive—but **risk is costlier**.

## 🧠 Interview-ready answer (short & strong)

> “Banks use Splunk as a centralized SIEM and observability platform for security monitoring, fraud detection, compliance auditing, and core banking application monitoring.”
