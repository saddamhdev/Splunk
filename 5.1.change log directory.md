Good question 👍
If **another project has a different log directory**, you have 3 clean ways to manage it in Splunk.

Let’s assume:

Project A → `/app/logs`
Project B → `/var/project2/logs`

Your Splunk container currently has:

```bash
-v /app/logs:/springlogs
```

So Splunk only sees Project A logs.

---

# ✅ Option 1 — Add Multiple Volume Mounts (Simple & Correct Way)

Modify your docker run:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name splunk \
  -p 3060:8000 \
  -p 8088:8088 \
  -v /app/logs:/springlogs/projectA \
  -v /logs:/springlogs/bank \
  -e SPLUNK_GENERAL_TERMS=--accept-sgt-current-at-splunk-com \
  -e SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license \
  -e SPLUNK_PASSWORD=Saddam@nvn123 \
  splunk/splunk:latest
```

Now inside container:

```
/springlogs/projectA
/springlogs/projectB
```

Then in Splunk:

Settings → Add Data → Monitor → `/springlogs/*`

🔥 This is clean and scalable.

# ✅ Option 2 — Standardize All Projects to One Central Log Directory (Best Practice)

Since you're building microservices architecture (like ICSQuiz style), better approach:

Create one central folder:

```
/central-logs/
    ├── projectA/
    ├── projectB/
    ├── gateway/
    ├── auth/
```

Then in each Spring Boot:

```yaml
logging:
  file:
    name: /central-logs/projectA/app.log
```

Then mount only once:

```bash
-v /central-logs:/springlogs
```

This is production-style log management.

# ✅ Option 3 — Use Splunk HEC (Enterprise Method 🚀)

You already exposed:

```
-p 8088:8088
```

That is **HTTP Event Collector**.

Instead of file logging:

Each project sends logs directly to:

```
http://your-server:8088/services/collector
```

No matter where the project runs:

* Local
* Docker
* VPS
* Kubernetes

Everything goes to Splunk directly.

This is the best architecture if you are running multiple projects on:

* Different machines
* Different droplets
* Different Kubernetes nodes

---

# 🎯 For You (Based on Your Setup)

Since you:

* Run multiple Spring Boot services
* Possibly different folders
* Might scale to VPS

I recommend:

### Development:

👉 Use multiple `-v` mounts (Option 1)

### Production:

👉 Use HEC (Option 3)

---

# 🔥 Example Splunk Search

If you separate by folder:

```
source="/springlogs/projectB/app.log"
```

Or better if using JSON:

```
service="projectB"
```

---

If you tell me:

👉 Are all projects on same machine?
👉 Or different VPS?
👉 Or inside Docker containers?

I’ll design the exact architecture for you.
