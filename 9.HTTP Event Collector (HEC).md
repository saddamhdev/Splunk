Good question 👍

These three `-p` lines are exposing **different ports of the Splunk container** to your machine.

Let’s explain clearly.

---

# 🧠 What `-p` Means in Docker

Format:

```bash
-p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT
```

It means:

> Map container’s internal port → to your local machine port.

---

# 🔹 `-p 3060:8000`

Inside Splunk container:

```text
8000 = Splunk Web UI
```

So:

```text
http://localhost:3060
```

Opens Splunk dashboard.

Without this → you cannot access Splunk UI.

---

# 🔹 `-p 8088:8088`

Inside container:

```text
8088 = HTTP Event Collector (HEC)
```

This is used when:

```text
Spring Boot → send logs via HTTP → Splunk
```

If you want to send logs directly (no file monitoring), you need 8088.

---

# 🔹 `-p 8089:8089`

Inside container:

```text
8089 = Splunk Management REST API
```

This is what your `splunk-service` uses:

```text
https://localhost:8089/services/search/jobs
```

If you don’t expose 8089:

Your Spring Boot app cannot call Splunk API.

# 🎯 Simple Summary

| Port | Used For                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 8000 | Web Dashboard                  |
| 8088 | Log ingestion (HEC)            |
| 8089 | REST API (Search, Admin, Jobs) |

# 🔥 Do You Need All Three?

If you want:

✔ Use UI → need 8000
✔ Send logs via HTTP → need 8088
✔ Query Splunk via API → need 8089

So yes — in your architecture you need all three.

---

# 🚀 If You Only Want API (No UI)

You could run only:

```bash
-p 8089:8089
```

But normally you keep 8000 too for monitoring.

---

# 🧠 Real Enterprise Setup

In production:

* 8000 → Internal network only
* 8089 → Internal microservice communication
* 8088 → Used by applications
* Sometimes behind reverse proxy
