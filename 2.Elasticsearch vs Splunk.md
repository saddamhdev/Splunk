## 🔍 How they think about data

### Elasticsearch mindset

* You **design indexes, mappings, shards**
* You control **schema, performance, scaling**
* Best when you want **full control**

### Splunk mindset

* You **ingest data and search**
* Most intelligence is **built-in**
* Best when you want **speed + security analytics**

---

## 🏦 Real-world usage

### Choose **Elasticsearch** if:

* You’re a **developer / architect**
* You want **low cost**
* You’re building:

  * Microservice logging
  * App search
  * Metrics & observability
* You already use **Spring Boot / Kubernetes**

### Choose **Splunk** if:

* You’re in **banking / enterprise / SOC**
* Security & compliance matter most
* You need:

  * SIEM
  * Audit trails
  * Threat detection
* Budget is not a blocker 💰

---

## ⚙️ Example: Spring Boot logs

### With Elasticsearch

```
Spring Boot → Filebeat → Elasticsearch → Kibana
```

✔ Cheap
✔ Flexible
❌ You build alerts & rules

### With Splunk

```
Spring Boot → Splunk Forwarder → Splunk
```

✔ Ready dashboards
✔ Security rules included
❌ License cost

## 🧠 Interview-ready takeaway

> **Elasticsearch is a search engine you engineer.
> Splunk is an analytics platform you operate.**
