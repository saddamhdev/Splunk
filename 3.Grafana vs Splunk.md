Both **Grafana** and **Splunk** deal with **monitoring & analysis**, but they solve **very different problems**.

---

## 🧠 One-line difference

* **Grafana** → *Visualize metrics & health*
* **Splunk** → *Analyze logs & security events*

Think:

> **Grafana = system heartbeat monitor**
> **Splunk = system investigator / security analyst**

## 🔍 Core comparison table

| Topic            | Grafana                     | Splunk                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Primary Focus    | Metrics & observability     | Logs, events & security |
| Data Type        | Metrics, traces (some logs) | Logs, events, metrics   |
| Built-in Storage | ❌ No (needs data source)    | ✅ Yes                   |
| Visualization    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (best-in-class)       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐                    |
| SIEM / Security  | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes (industry leader) |
| Alerting         | Basic → Advanced            | Very advanced           |
| Cost             | Free / Open-source          | Expensive               |
| Learning Curve   | Easy–Medium                 | Medium                  |
| Best For         | DevOps, SRE                 | SOC, Enterprise IT      |

## 🧩 How they actually work

### Grafana

Grafana **does NOT store data**
It **reads from**:

* Prometheus
* Loki (logs)
* Elasticsearch
* InfluxDB
* CloudWatch, etc.

📊 Its superpower = **beautiful dashboards**

---

### Splunk

Splunk:

* Collects data
* Stores it
* Indexes it
* Searches it
* Detects threats

🔐 Its superpower = **log intelligence + SIEM**

---

## ⚙️ Practical example (Spring Boot app)

### With Grafana

```
Spring Boot
 → Micrometer
 → Prometheus
 → Grafana
```

You see:

* CPU usage
* Request latency
* Error rate
* JVM memory

👉 **Health & performance**

---

### With Splunk

```
Spring Boot
 → Splunk Forwarder
 → Splunk
```

You see:

* Full stack traces
* Login failures
* Suspicious access
* Audit logs

👉 **Forensics & security**

---

## 🏦 Who uses what?

### Grafana is used by

* Startups
* Cloud-native teams
* DevOps / SRE
* Kubernetes users

### Splunk is used by

* Banks
* Telecom
* Government
* SOC teams

## 🧠 Brutally honest summary

| Question                | Winner     |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Best dashboards         | 🏆 Grafana |
| Best security           | 🏆 Splunk  |
| Cheapest                | 🏆 Grafana |
| Log investigation       | 🏆 Splunk  |
| Cloud-native monitoring | 🏆 Grafana |
| Compliance & audit      | 🏆 Splunk  |

---

## 🔑 Final takeaway

> **Grafana tells you *something is wrong*.
> Splunk tells you *what happened, who did it, and how*.**

If you want, I can next explain:

* **Grafana vs Kibana**
* **Grafana + ELK vs Splunk (full architecture)**
* **What banks use Grafana for, even when they have Splunk**
* **Interview question answers (short & sharp)**

Just tell me 👌
